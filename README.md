# Drowsiness Detection System

## Description
The Drowsiness Detection System is a Python-based application that utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect signs of drowsiness in individuals, particularly focusing on eye closure patterns. The system processes video streams from webcams, analyzes facial landmarks, and monitors eye behavior in real-time. When drowsiness is detected, the system raises alerts to help prevent potential accidents, especially in scenarios like driving or operating heavy machinery.
